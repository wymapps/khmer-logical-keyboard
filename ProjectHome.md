Project will help the users feel easy to type Khmer on Android phone.

The keyboard will provide three input states:  Normal, Shift, and Long Press. And it will adhere to three principles:

- Khmer characters will be divided into 3 groups based on frequency of use:

1) set of frequently used characters will be assigned to the normal state.

2) less frquently used characters will be assigned to the Shift state of the layout.

3) characters rarely used  in conversation, will be assigned to the Long Press state.

- It will not be a phonetic layout derived from QWERTY or AZERTY layouts.

- It will not include combined vowels and characters which are never used in conversation.
